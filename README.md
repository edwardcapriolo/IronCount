IronCount
=============

IronCount provides a framework to manage consumers of Kafka topics across multiple nodes.

Components
-----
IronCount works with three components. Two components are external Kafka and ZooKeeper. IronCount
has one component named WorkloadManager that runs on multiple machines. 

Workloads
-----

A Workload is an object that stores several pieces of information.

* name: System wide unique name for the Workload
* topic: Name of the Kafka topic this handler will get data from
* messageHandlerName: Class that implements MessageHandler interface 
* zkConnect: Information to connect to zookeeper
* maxWorkers: Maximum number of instances of MessageHander to run across the cluster
* properties: A map of properties that can be used for configuration
* active: a flag to start or pause workloads
* classloaderUrls: if specified as list of URLs used for URL class loading

In a serialized form a workload looks like this:

    {
      "name":"testworkload"
      ,"topic":"topic1"
      ,"consumerGroup":"group1"
      ,"messageHandlerName":"com.jointhegrid.ironcount.eventtofile.MessageToFileHandler"
      ,"zkConnect":"localhost:2181"
      ,"maxWorkers":4
      ,"properties":{"aprop":"avalue"}
      ,"active":true
    }

To start a Workload create a JSON clob like the one above and save it to a file. Then use
DeployTool to write this entry to ZooKeeper. You can also use JMX and the applyWorkload(String) operation. 
After the change is applied the WorkloadManagers should notice
the changes to zookeeper and start instances of the Workload.

Extending
-----

The first step is to implement the `MessageHandler` interface. Each worker constructs the handler
once. Then each kafka message is passed to the `handleMessage(Message m)` method. 

    package com.jointhegrid.ironcount.mockingbird;

    import com.jointhegrid.ironcount.MessageHandler;
    import com.jointhegrid.ironcount.WorkerThread;
    import com.jointhegrid.ironcount.Workload;
    import kafka.message.Message;

    public class MessageHandlerExt implements MessageHandler{

      public MessageHandlerExt(){}

      @Override
      public void setWorkload(Workload w) {
      }

      @Override
      public void handleMessage(MessageAndMetadata<Message> m) {
      }

      @Override
      public void setWorkerThread(WorkerThread wt) {
      }
    
      @Override
      public void stop(){
      }

    }

Demos
-----

IronCount has some build in demo's to show it's usefulness. The first is MockingBird, which offers Rainbird 
style URL counting and data persistance to Cassandra. See `com.jointhegrid.ironcount.mockingbird.*` in the 
test packages.

    public void handleMessage(Message m) {
      String url = getMessage(m);
      URI i = URI.create(url);
      String domain = i.getHost();
      String path = i.getPath();
      String[] parts = domain.split("\\.");
      Stack<String> s = new Stack<String>();
      s.add(path);
      s.addAll(Arrays.asList(parts));
      StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

      for (int j = 0; j <= parts.length; j++) {
        sb.append(s.pop());
        countIt(sb.toString());//write to C*
        sb.append(":");
      }
    }

The framework takes care of the transport of messages and allows the user to focus on application logic.

The second demo is a Join similar to s4's join demo. This one is implemented with two Kafka topics,
a topic named `map` and a topic named `reduce`. The `MapHandler` handles messages from the map topic, processes
them and then send them to the `reduce` topic. 

    @Override
    public void setWorkload(Workload w) {
      this.w=w;
      producerProps = new Properties();
      producerProps.put("serializer.class", "kafka.serializer.StringEncoder");
      producerProps.put("zk.connect", w.properties.get("zk.connect"));
      producerConfig = new ProducerConfig(producerProps);
      producer = new Producer<String,String>(producerConfig);
    }

    @Override
    public void handleMessage(Message m) {
      //message looks like this
      //users|1:edward
      //or
      //cart|1:saw
      String line = getMessage(m);
      String[] parts = line.split("\\|");
      String table = parts[0];
      String row = parts[1];
      String [] columns = row.split(":");

      //results look like this
      //Partitioner (1) users|1:edward
      //or
      //partitioner (1) cart|1:saw

      producer.send(new ProducerData<String, String>
        ("reduce", columns[0], Arrays.asList(table+"|"+row)));
    }

Kafka has the notion of partitioners and the join key is used internally to route 
messages for the same user_id to the same partition of a topic.  The ReduceHandler writes
partial aggreggations as Cassandra counters made possible by Kafka's underlying partitioning. 

In this example the map Workload creates data for the reduce Workload. You can imagine this
as a pipe or a feedback loop.

    @Override
    public void handleMessage(Message m) {
      String line = getMessage(m);
      String[] parts = line.split("\\|");
      String table = parts[0];
      String row = parts[1];
      String [] columns = row.split(":");

      if (table.equals("user")) {
        User u = new User();
        u.parse(columns);
        if (! data.containsKey(u)){
          data.put(u, new ArrayList<Item>());
        }
      } else if ( table.equals("cart")){
        Item i = new Item();
        i.parse(columns);
        for (User u : data.keySet()){
          if (u.id==i.userfk){
            data.get(u).add(i);
            //counter (items for user)
            incrementItemCounter(u);
            //count ($ spent by user)
            incrementDollarByUser(u,i);
          }
        }
      }
    }

See `com.jointhegrid.ironcount.mapreduce` for example code.

Unit Tests
-----

Currently IronCount has integration tests. Tests are passing when run one at a time.
Many of the services started by the integration tests have re-entrant code
sections they will soon be converted to a test suite or forked. Currently to build the 
artifact `mvn -D maven.test.skip=true` is required.

Running
-----

IronCount runs with Kafka in the zookeeper enabled configuration. You should see the 
Kafka documention if you need help with that part of the setup. IronCount uses ZooKeeper
to store information on Workloads and coordinate who is running what.

To bootstram IronCount only needs to know how to locate the ZooKeeper cluster.

    bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties &
    bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties &

Start IronCount

    java -cp ironcount-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.jointhegrid.ironcount.ICLauncher &

Use DeployTool to lauch a workload.
 
    java -cp ironcount-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.jointhegrid.ironcount.DeployTool deploy src/test/resources/workload.json

The example workload writes all queue data to a local file. Open a tail session on the file.

    $ tail -f /tmp/abc

In another window use the Kafka producer shell to send messages that Kafka and IronCount process to finally be written to the file. They should appear in the file.

    bin/kafka-producer-shell.sh --server kafka://localhost:9092 --topic topic1
